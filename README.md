It captures live video from your webcam and predicts emotions like **Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral, Disgust, Fear** etc.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time emotion recognition  
- Uses a trained CNN model (`.h5`, `.json`)  
- Easy to run and modify  

## ⚙️ Installation
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/priyanshsoni30/Face-Emotion-Detection.git
  cd Face-Emotion-Detection
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
## ▶️ Run
```bash
  python realtimedetection.py
  ```

## 📂 Files

- realtimedetection.py → Run live emotion detection

- facialemotionmodel.h5 / .json → Trained model files

- trainedmodel.ipynb → Model training notebook

## 📈 Future Work

- Improve accuracy with advanced models (e.g. MTCNN)

- Add GUI for better user experience
